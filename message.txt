# Hi, my Love

You have never criticise the moon for not shining the same each night .  You have never looked up at it and say, you're not trying hard enough ,  because the moon doesn't have to be full and bright every night to be loved , and neither do you . 
So I hope that the next person who calls you "beautiful" does so in a way that encompasses all of you .   I hope when they call you beautiful they mean your voice in the morning and those light brown eyes , and boy!! How they light up when you talk about what you're passionate about .   I hope when they call you beautiful they mean the way you go through tough battles silently and still show up for everyone with a smile.  I hope they mean the way you sleep and the way you cry , the way you love with every fibber of your being, and the way you take your tea  because next time someone calls you beautiful. Nothing about the way you exist should be disregarded .
You are not beautiful in the way a single rose petal is. You are beautiful in the way a garden is .

Yours forever,
Amakirimo
