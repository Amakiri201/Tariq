# My Dearest,

In your presence ,  I've learned that just as the moon waxes and wanes, its luminance never diminishes in my eyes .  Never once have you faulted the moon for its gentle shifts , nor demanded it to shine brighter. You understand its beauty lies not in constant radiance, but in its ever-changing grace.
So , I pray that when next someone calls you "beautiful ,"  May they hear your morning voice as a symphony , your eyes as light brown eyes , so enchanting ,  and your passion as a constellation ablaze.
May they admire the way you dress , not just in garments or gowns , but in confidence and authenticity .  May they recognize the strength in your silence during trials , and the resilience that carries you through .
When they speak of beauty , may they speak of your sleep , your tears , and every nuance of your being .  May they appreciate your love for touch , the warmth of your embrace , and the way your presence lights up any room .  And when summer shorts adorn you , may they marvel at the allure you effortlessly exude .  For when they call you beautiful ,  it must encompass every facet of your existence .  You are not merely a petal , but an entire garden , teeming with life , color , and boundless potential .

With all my love,
Amakirimo
